## Filtering Tasks

Quickly organize your tasks using the filters at the top:

| Button            | Function                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **All**           | Shows every task.                             |
| **Completed**     | Displays only completed tasks.                |
| **Not Completed** | Displays only tasks you still need to finish. |

**Example:**  
Add three tasks → mark one as completed → click **Completed** to see it, or **Not Completed** to view the rest.
